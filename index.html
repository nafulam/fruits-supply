  <h1>problem encountered</h1>

I have been able to buy seeds so as to grow the fruits so as to be able to sell to them.my project have entails many fruits like oranges,pawpaws,mangoes,pineapples and lemons.<br>
I also have some workmen who have beeen helping me in digging and planting them.<br>

There has been alot of work encountered during planting because it also grow well depenting on the way they grew them.There has been insecurity because it has not been fenced but i have been able to buy greenhouses to fence them.<br>
</p>

I will be also required to have many contacts so as to contact the companies to take the fruits if ready.<br>
